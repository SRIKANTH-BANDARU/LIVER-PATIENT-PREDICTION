# LIVER-PATIENT-PREDICTION
This liver patient prediction project aims to develop a predictive model leveraging machine learning to identify individuals at risk of liver disease early, improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare resource allocation.

The dataset used for this project contains information about Liver Patients, Liver Deases Factors. By leveraging Random Forest	algorithms and ensemble methods like Logistic Regression, the model will learn patterns in the data to make predictions about future attrition.

Key Features:

Dataset Exploration: Understanding the structure and content of the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for modeling.

Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features that contribute to Liver Patients Prediction.

Model Building: Implementing random forest classifiers and  Logistic Regression to train predictive models.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment: Deploying the trained model to make real-time predictions or integrating it into existing systems.

Through this project, i have shown promising results in predicting outcomes for Liver Patients. By levaraging various data points such personal information, Blood test results, and Liver condition studies this model can help health care providers identify patients at riskof Liver Deases and make informed decision regarding treatment. The code and documentation will be made available on GitHub for anyone interested in replicating the project or exploring further.
